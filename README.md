**The Impact of CO2 Emission on Sales of New Light-duty Vehicles**

This project is to build a prediction model of C02 emissions of light vehicles for a period of 10 years and its impact on the pricing of vehicles.
We have a dataset which contains various features of the car based on which we predict the Carbon dioxide emission.
This dataset contains fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.      
Data Source: 'https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64'

Here is a description of some of the features that are in the dataset.

1. MODELYEAR e.g. 2014
2. MAKE e.g. Acura
3. MODEL e.g. ILX
4. VEHICLE CLASS e.g. SUV
5. ENGINE SIZE e.g. 4.7
6. CYLINDERS e.g 6
7. TRANSMISSION e.g. A6
8. FUEL CONSUMPTION in CITY(L/100 km) e.g. 9.9
9. FUEL CONSUMPTION in HWY (L/100 km) e.g. 8.9
10. FUEL CONSUMPTION COMB (L/100 km) e.g. 9.2
11. CO2 EMISSIONS (g/km) e.g. 182 --> low --> 0
